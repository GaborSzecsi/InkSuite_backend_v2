    "description": "Penguin and Panda should not be friends. The very idea is absurd. Penguin likes to build things and Panda likes to nap. Panda munches bamboo and Penguin gobbles cheese puffs and jam-banana sandwiches. Penguin never powers down and Panda has a hard time powering up. There is no way their friendship would ever work. Except somehow, it does.\n\nIn the tradition of Narwal and Jelly, here is an extremely commercial illustrated chapter book/graphic novel series for young readers. Bright, kid-friendly illustrations are full of humor. An odd couple buddy comedy featuring two buddies who clearly love each other. The author is an elementary school teacher, so she knows the voices, the audience, and she knows what teachers look for in books like these. \n\nSimple dialogue belies the depth of Penguin’s and Panda’s conversations; dig deep and you’ll find hints of moral philosophy—just like in Winnie the Pooh.\n\nAt $9.99 for 4 complete stories, plus a few kid-friendly extras, the package is a bargain. Five-book commitment from the outset, with the first two titles debuting simultaneously so kids won’t have to wait for another, and so booksellers know we’re serious in our support for this series.",

    "description": "Penguin and Panda should not be friends. The very idea is absurd. Penguin likes to build things and Panda likes to nap. Panda munches bamboo and Penguin gobbles cheese puffs and jam-banana sandwiches. Penguin never powers down and Panda has a hard time powering up. There is no way their friendship would ever work. Except somehow, it does.\n\nIn the tradition of Narwal and Jelly, here is an extremely commercial illustrated chapter book/graphic novel series for young readers. Bright, kid-friendly illustrations are full of humor. An odd couple buddy comedy featuring two buddies who clearly love each other. The author is an elementary school teacher, so she knows the voices, the audience, and she knows what teachers look for in books like these. \n\nSimple dialogue belies the depth of Penguin’s and Panda’s conversations; dig deep and you’ll find hints of moral philosophy—just like in Winnie the Pooh.\n\nAt $9.99 for 4 complete stories, plus a few kid-friendly extras, the package is a bargain. Five-book commitment from the outset, with the first two titles debuting simultaneously so kids won’t have to wait for another, and so booksellers know we’re serious in our support for this series.",

Like most babies, he grows bigger . . . taller . . . HUGER! A Giant Baby! Bulldozers and garbage trucks become his toys. Shipping containers and skyscrapers become blocks, the moon becomes a nightlight, and the whole world becomes a playground. \n\nUntil, that is, Ezra’s parents want to check on him in bed. And then it’s stomp stomp stomp back home. Can he make it back inside his crib in time? \n\nFrom Liz Rosenberg (Monster Mama) and Eva Byrne (Along Came Coco), this fun and funny bedtime adventure follows baby Ezra, who waits until his parents are asleep to grow bigger, taller, HUGER . . . and to make the city itself his plaything",

    "description": "Perfect for fans of Nicola Yoon’s The Sun is Also a Star and John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars,  Into the Deep Blue is Fiona and Nick’s achingly moving, wry, and hopeful tale about falling apart and coming together told from two unforgettable points of view, \n\nNick and Fiona were meant to be friends—best friends—and they wouldn’t change that for the world. At least, that’s what they tell themselves. Because they can’t be an us. Nick doesn’t believe in happy endings ever since they both lost their moms unexpectedly senior year. And Fiona often wonders if all they have in common is their numb hearts. Still, they’re content to share everything else with each other. Honestly. Everything but sparks.  \n\nBut when Fiona accidentally lets her guard down more than she intended to with Nick, it threatens to ruin their fragile balancing act. Luckily, Nick isn’t about to let a little misunderstanding get in the way of the weekend trip they’ve been planning for months. Fiona is just hoping for some closure on the first anniversary of her mom’s death—except grief isn’t that simple, and choosing to love again isn’t, either. Now the only thing standing between Fiona and Nick is the truth. They just need the courage to reach for it. \n\n“Into the Deep Blue is YA contemporary at its best. Archer’s rich, complicated characters, spitfire pacing, and heartfelt interactions intertwine so effortlessly on every page. Nick and Fiona will steal your hearts in this layered expression of grief and hope, heartache and healing. A true gem.” —Laura Taylor Namey, New York Times bestselling author of A Cuban Girl’s Guide to Tea and Tomorrow",

Short logline: Into the Deep Blue follows Nick and Fiona, best friends who met in group therapy, struggling to put the pieces of their lives together after loss. The last thing they need is to fall in love. When a weekend trip brings their deepening feelings to the surface they might sooner cut each other off than face them. Slightly longer one here: Nick Bennet is an expert at messing up. Maybe not as much as his older sister, but he really upped his game by getting a DUI, a license suspension, and mandatory grief counseling after their mom died. Now, he’s trying to put the pieces of his life together. He wants to get away from his family and go to college in New York to be a writer, but his dad is betting against him. Nick will mess up again—it’s what he does best. The last thing he needs is to fall in love with Fiona, his only friend from therapy. His only friend—period. With Fiona, he can be himself, darkly funny, lonely, a closet optimist, and more honest than he’s ever been in his life. Fiona gets it—this rollercoaster called grief—she’s stuck on it too. Fiona’s everything he’s not. She socializes in therapy, her gymnastics students adore her, and she has actual friends who care about her.",

She has studied at Minneapolis Community College, Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and many artists’ private studios. Colleen likes to say she is community educated since her most valuable education is from fellow artists, workshops, and conferences. \n\nAfter taking her first Children’s Book Illustration class, Colleen knew she had found her calling. Writing classes at The Loft Literary Center soon followed. Many classes and many drafts later, her stories are coming to life! Colleen’s art is full of nature, animals, and everyday life. Her favorite artists are Grandma Moses, Barbara Cooney and Henri Matisse, Colleen’s artwork is overflowing with pattern, color, and texture. \n\nColleen lives in Stillwater, Minnesota with her husband in a 146-year-old house. They share their house with three dogs and two cats who inspire many of her stories.",

When Linden gets sick, the community comes together to help him, but nothing works. Linden is grateful he was so useful and loved by the community.

    "description": "The summer before middle school is a time of anxiety and change. A pitch-perfect novel in verse about one girl’s wish to simultaneously break free and to belong. \n\nIn the summer before her first year of middle school, word-chanting, rope-skipping Phee skips her way to imagined fame, writes down her innermost secret thoughts from the safety of a treehouse, and imagines in horror that her new classmates will eat her alive. Suddenly, her well-worn alley world feels too small. So when Mercy Jones moves next door, along with Mercy’s skateboard and her don’t-mess-with-me attitude, Phee sees the chance for her universe to expand. Even if it means leaving some things behind . . . It is a time of dares, of a legendary dog named Bull, of stretching comfort zones, and of old friendships made over in new ways. And it all takes place over the course of one alley summer. \n\nUsing pitch-perfect, richly rendered verse, Anne Ylvisaker captures the tone and insights of one girl’s wish to simultaneously break free and to belong.",

Whether it’s Penguin’s first campout (in the dark!) or her strange competition with the new neighbor, she is definitely feeling all the feels. Panda, Mr. Low-Key, is always happy to offer up sage wisdom, but his inability to stop putting things off comes back to bite him when he ruins a special Fun Friday. \n\nPenned by a gifted-education specialist, and full of hilarious illustrations and a generous spirit of friendship, In the Dark is perfect for early readers. If you’ve enjoyed Narwhal and Jelly, give this funny duo a try.",

    "description": "A JLG Gold Standard selection  \n\nPraised as “reminiscent of Calvin and Hobbes” by Kirkus Reviews, and “the perfect mix of heart, humor, and hilarity” by Big Nate creator Lincoln Peirce, this comic strip-turned-graphic-novel series hits the sweet spot for both kids and any pet-obsessed grownups. \n\nWags to Wishes, Book 3 of this middle-grade graphic novel series starring Sophie the chocolate lab, pokes gently at family power structures. Still reeling from all the new additions to her family (a human baby along with various stray dogs and cats), Sophie decides that – as the alpha – it is up to her to protect them all. And so she tries . . . from an island of temptation made entirely of desserts, to an army of discarded chew toys seeking revenge for lost squeakers, to the cats’ unending pursuit to rule humanity, Sophie’s adventures are epic, fun, and funny.",

Wolves in Montana and Idaho will remain unprotected because they were delisted by Congress in 2011. Wolves in Wyoming were delisted by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2017.
